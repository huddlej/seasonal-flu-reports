abstract: "A1b/159N continues to dominate recent H3N2 circulation with new clusters observed in the USA, Russia, and the Netherlands. Few H1N1pdm strains exist for the last month. B/Victoria remains split into clades in China and those outside of China. Outside of China, B/Victoria has circulated widely."

# [Recent H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)

165 genomes in the last month with most (137) from A1b/159N, 26 from A1b/186S, and 2 from A1b/137F.
A1b/186S strains are limited to Laos and Thailand.
A1b/137F strains are both from France.

# [Most recent A1b/159N strains descend from 156S + 53N or 53G subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=full)

These include clusters in the USA, Russian, the Netherlands and Spain.

# [A large cluster in Maryland comprises a third of recent A1b/159N strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree&f_country=Usa&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&m=div&p=full)

The Maryland cluster (N=48) derives from the 156S+D53G subclade of A1b/159N and has picked up additional HA1 mutations including L157I and S262N.
One strain has a F79L mutation.
Other recent A1b/159N strains include one from Alaska (also in the 156S subclade but with D53N) and from Michigan (with a E50K mutation).

# [Large cluster in Russia also descends from 156S and D53G subclade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree&f_country=Russia&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/159N&m=div&p=full)

Another large cluster in Russia (N=20) also descends from the 156S+D53G subclade.
This cluster carries HA1 mutations at I25V, R201K, and S219Y.
Although the common ancestor of these strains likely originated in early 2021, its descendants have only been observed in Russia.
One strain has an RBS-adjacent mutation at HA1:S145R.

# [Large cluster in the Netherlands and Spain](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&gt=HA1.53N&m=div&p=full)

Another large cluster (N=28) in the Netherlands consists of mostly identical strains with 6 closely related strains collected in Spain.
Closely related strains from Nepal and Australia suggest more widespread travel connections than in previous data

# [Recent A1b/186S strains originate in Laos and Thailand](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_140&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/186S&m=div&p=grid)

Two strains from Laos have a I140K mutation.
No other notable mutations appear in recent A1b/186S strains.

# [HA1:50K mutation in recent A1b/137F strains has occurred multiple times independently](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202101&gt=HA1.50K&p=grid)

The HA1:E50K mutation observed in the two recent A1b/137F strains has occurred multiple times independently in the last year.

# [A1b/159N subclade with 156S has the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree&p=full)

The 156S subclade has an LBI of 1.0.

# [A1b/159N subclade with 156S is most antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?c=cTiterSub&d=tree&p=full)

# [HA1:261Q mutation is associated with higher antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?c=cTiterSub&d=tree&gt=HA1.261Q&p=full)

261Q has occurred many times in the last decade including most recently in West Africa and India.
This site is one of the Wolf et al. epitope positions.

# [A1b/159N is still predicted to represent future populations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,frequencies&l=scatter&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

Both forecasting models agree that A1b/159N is most representative of future H3N2 populations.

# [Recent H1N1pdm circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)

Only 5 strains of H1N1pdm have been submitted in the last month including 2 from 5a.1, 2 from 5a.2, and 1 from A1.
These strains were collected in the USA, France, Japan, and Bangladesh.

The A1 strain is from North Dakota and maps to a long branch with 10 amino acid mutations 
The 5a.1 strain from Japan predates the pandemic.
The 5a.1 from France carries no new mutations.
The new 5a.2 strains from Bangladesh and the USA cluster near an existing strain from India.

# [Recent Vic circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)

127 B/Vic strains were submitted in the last month.
105 of these descend from 3a2, 21 from 3a1, and one from the V1A.3 subclade with 133R.

# [3a1 remains in China](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&label=clade:3a1&p=grid)

No recent strains have been observed outside of China.

# [3a2 remains split between China and a globally distributed subclade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&label=clade:3a2&p=grid)

No recent strains of the 3a2 subclade with HA1:H122Q have been observed outside of China.
Outside of China, 3a2 has been circulating in France, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the USA.

# [Many recently circulating 3a2 strains carry a HA1:197E mutation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&gt=HA1.197E&p=grid)

Two large subclades of 3a2 have 197E mutations and are globally distributed.

# [Recent strains from France map to a 3a2 cluster in Africa and Russia](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&gt=HA1.182A,197E&m=div&p=grid)

Recent strains from France expand the size of this geographically structured cluster.

# [Recent strains from Nepal, Bangladesh, and USA map to a small 3a2 subclade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&gt=HA1.197E,nuc.329G&p=grid)

One 3a2 subclade with a 197E mutation has a wide geographic distribution.
Recent strains from Nepal, Bangladesh, and the USA map to this clade.
We now see identical strains collected in the Philippines, the USA, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia.
Closely related strains circulate in Nepal, the USA, and the Netherlands.
As with recent H3N2 circulation patterns, these data indicate expanded international travel.

# [Chinaâ€™s 3a1 and 3a2 clades are the fastest growing](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-10-28/vic/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree&m=div&p=full)

A recent 3a1 subclade has an LBI of 0.71.
A recent 3a2 subclade of the 122Q subclade has an LBI of 1.0.
