# [Recent H3N2 strains](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&dmin=2020-08-12&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)

66 H3N2 strains were submitted in the last week or month and collected since August 2020.
A1b/94N is circulating in Asia and Oceania.
A1b/186D is circulating in West Africa.

# [A1b/94N](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&dmin=2020-08-12&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

Recently submitted strains from A1b/94N have been circulating in Japan, Australia, Thailand, and Cambodia.
These recent strains include mutations at HA1:156Q and S (a Koel epitope site), HA1:171N and K, and HA1:274V.

# [A1b/94N strains carry HA1:156Q and S mutations](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_156&d=tree,map&gt=HA1.156Q,156S&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

These mutations occur at a Koel epitope site near the receptor binding domain.
Strains with these mutations have circulated in the US, United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, and Australia.

# [Recent A1b/94N strains carry HA1:171N mutations](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_171&d=tree,map&dmin=2021-01-01&gt=HA1.171N&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

# [Australia has both A1b/94N subclades](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_159&d=tree,map&dmin=2021-02-01&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

The 159N and 193S subclades are both circulating in Australia, while 193S is also found in Japan.

# [A1b/186D](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&dmin=2020-08-12&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/186D&p=grid)

Recently submitted strains from A1b/186D have been circulating Senegal, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Republic of Congo.

# [Several HA1:131K mutations have emerged in A1b/186D in Africa](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_131&d=tree,map&dmin=2020-08-12&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/186D&p=grid)

HA1:131I, K, and N have circulated in Niger, Republic of Congo, and Cameroon.

# [94N's Bangladeshi subclade with 159N dominates the local branching index](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-04-19/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&f_clade_membership=A1b/94N&gt=HA1.159N&l=scatter&p=full)
