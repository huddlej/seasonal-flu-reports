dataset: "https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid"
abstract: "All three major lineages have been circulating globally with some countries like the USA observing strains from each lineage in the last few months.
In H3N2, A1b/159 continues to dominate and its HA1:156S subclade continues to grow.
In H1N1pdm, A5a.2 remains at the highest frequency (62%) with the more antigenic advance and highest LBI.
In B/Vic, 3a2 continues to dominate with near-global circulation since May 2021 (with the exception of South America).
Recent patterns support the selections for vaccine strains at the September 2021 VCM."

# [Recent H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)

225 genomes in the last month with most (221) from A1b/159N, one from A1b/186D in Sweden, one from 3c3.A in Australia, and two from “A1b/135K” in Oman.
These recent data continue to support the pattern of A1b/159N dominance and sustained circulation of other clades in specific geographic locales.

# [3c3.A continues to circulate in Australia](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&label=clade:3c3.A&p=grid)

This strain from Newcastle carries an HA1:Y56H.
This is a reversion from the genotype in all recent 3c3.A strains.

# [Recent A1b/135K strains map to long branches in limited geographic locations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&label=clade:A1b/135K&p=grid)

Strains from Oman are the first from a non-A1b/186D subclade since March 2020.
These strains carry three HA1 mutations including N31S, H56Y, and D85N.
Latest A1b/186D strain has one amino acid mutation per gene segment.

# [Multiple distinct subclades of A1b/186D circulates in Europe and Africa](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20quarter,last%20week&label=clade:A1b/186D&p=grid)

Until recently, A1b/186D strains all mapped to long branches and different countries. Now we have strains mapping to distinct subclades of the tree and circulating in specific countries like Ghana and Sweden.

# [Multiple lineage of A1b/186D have been circulating in Ghana](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&f_country=Ghana&p=grid&label=clade:A1b/186D)

At least two distinct lineages of A1b/186D were circulating in Ghana this summer.

# [A1b/159N subclades exhibit geographic structure despite global distribution](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree,map,frequencies&dmin=2021-04-01&p=grid&label=clade:A1b/159N)

Most recent A1b/159N strains carry the HA1:156S mutation now with the ancestral 156H genotype apparently being outcompeted in regions where both exist (e.g., USA, Russia, Spain).
With 156S, the HA1:53N and HA1:53G subclades dominate.
Although 156S strains are nearly globally distributed (notably missing from South America and Africa, so far), these HA1:53 subclades are more geographically structured.
The 53G subclade appears mostly in Lebanon, the USA, and Russia, while 53N appears in Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, and India.

# [A1b/159N subclades exhibit geographic structure despite global distribution](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree,map&dmin=2021-04-01&l=scatter&p=grid&scatterY=country&label=clade:A1b/159N)

The timeline view in the scatterplot highlights how 156S has replaced the ancestral genotype in most countries.

# [A1b/159N subclades exhibit geographic structure despite global distribution](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree&dmin=2021-04-01&l=scatter&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=full&scatterY=country)

The timeline view in the scatterplot highlights how 156S has replaced the ancestral genotype in most countries.

# [156S is associated with antigenic advance but not 53G or N](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&p=full&label=clade:A1b/159N)

Based on recent ferret FRA data alone, the 53G and N mutations do not appear to confer any antigenic advance on top of the 156S mutation.

# [LBI for the 156S subclade is higher than its 53G/N subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=lbi&d=tree&p=full&label=clade:A1b/159N)

# [53N has a slightly higher LBI than 53G](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53&d=tree&f_clade_membership=A1b/159N&l=scatter&p=full&scatterY=lbi)

There may be a slight advantage to 53N over G, but this pattern could be strongly biased by differences in sequencing/submission by region (e.g., 53N is primarily in the USA where surveillance efforts are robust).

# [Forecasts from LBI slightly favor 53N strains from A1b/159N compared to HI-based model](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&branches=hide&c=gt-HA1_53,156,159&d=tree,frequencies&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

The LBI model slightly favors the 53N subclade of A1b/159N, most likely because this clade at slightly higher frequency right now

# [In H1N1pdm, frequencies of A5a.1 and A5a.2 remain stable and unevenly distributed globally](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135,202136,202137,202140,202144&p=grid)

# [Most recently submitted H1N1pdm data map to A5a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)

27 strains of H1N1pdm were submitted in the last month with 24 from A5a.2 and two from A5a.1.
All but three A5a.2 strains were collected in Bangladesh

# [Most recent A5a.2 strains were in Bangladesh](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A5a.2&p=grid)

With the exception of one strain from Sweden and two strains from Bahrain, all A5a.2 strains are from Bangladesh.

# [Recent A5a.2 strains carry a sustained HA1:T216A mutation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_94,216&d=tree,map,frequencies&p=grid)

Strains from the subclade with HA1:T216T have transmitted to the USA and Europe from India and Bangladesh.

# [Recent A5a.1 strains were in the USA, Spain, and England](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&label=clade:A5a.1&p=grid)

These three countries have also experienced recent H3N2 circulation.

# [A5a subclades are geographically structured](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=tree,map,frequencies&dmin=2021-02-25&p=grid)

A5a.1 and A5a.2 are nearly even in global frequency (at 43% and 54%, respectively).
Despite their dominance, these clades remain mostly structured geographically with A5a.1 found mostly in Africa and Europe and A5a.2 found mostly in India and Bangladesh.
For example, only A5a.1 has been found in Qatar so far, but only A5a.2 has been found in neighboring Bahrain.
The USA is an exception where both clades have been observed at higher frequencies (along with a single strain from A1 in North Dakota).

# [A5a.2 remains the most antigenically advanced clade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?c=cTiterSub&d=tree&p=full)

Ferret HI data continue to support A5a.2 as antigenically advanced.
Interestingly, none of the recent HA1 mutations observed in India and Bangladesh carry any antigenic weight from the titer substitution model.

# [A5a.2 also has the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree,map&p=full)

These higher LBI values map to the most recent strains from India and Bangladesh.

# [3a2 continues to dominate recent B/Vic strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143&p=grid)

3a2 represents 78% of recent B/Vic strains.
V1A.3 remains steady while 3a1 appears to decline while limited to circulation in China.

# [Recently submitted Vic data are from 3a1 and V1A.3](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)

91 B/Victoria strains were submitted in the last month.
54 of these descend from 3a2, none are from 3a1, and 37 are from V1A.3.
We have no new data from China in the last month.

# [V1A.3](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?c=country&d=tree,map&f_clade_membership=V1A.3&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)

Of the 37 recently submitted V1A.3 strains, 30 (81%) were collected in Haiti in late 2020 and early 2021.
The remaining 7 were collected in the USA in September and October 2021 (in Arizona, Wisconsin, and New Mexico).
34 of the 37 V1A.3 strains (92%) descend from the 133R subclade.

# [Recent V1A.3 strains from the USA appear part of a long-circulating subclade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_73&d=tree,entropy&f_clade_membership=V1A.3&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202120&p=full)

The most recent common ancestor of these V1A.3 strains from Arizona, Wisconsin, and New Mexico dates back to May 2021, but these strains belong to a larger subclade with strains in Texas and Arizona dating back to February 2020 (with very wide confidence intervals including March 2019 and May 2021).
The most recent 7 genomes are all identical despite spanning 3 states.

# [Outside of China, 3a2 strains since May carry 197E and 202V mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_197,202&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143&f_region=Africa,Europe,Japan%20Korea,North%20America,Oceania,South%20America,South%20Asia,West%20Asia,Southeast%20Asia&label=clade:3a2&p=grid)

The 202V subclade has circulated in South Africa, France, India, Bangladesh, Singapore, and Australia.
The 197E subclade has circulated in 10 different countries across 7 regions.

# [3a2 has arrived recently in India](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_197,202&d=tree&f_epiweek=202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143&f_region=Africa,Europe,Japan%20Korea,North%20America,Oceania,South%20America,South%20Asia,West%20Asia,Southeast%20Asia&l=scatter&label=clade:3a2&p=full&scatterY=country)

After circulating extensively in South Africa, Bangladesh, and Singapore this last summer, 3a2 was just observed in India in September 2021.
This clade also just arrived in England and the Netherlands.

# [3a2 remains antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?branches=hide&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&f_epiweek=202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143&l=scatter&p=full&scatterX=clade_membership)

3a2 is nearly 2 log2 titers more advanced than 3a1 and more than 3 log2 titers from V1A.3.

# [3a2 also has the highest LBI of circulating clades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-11-25/vic/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree&f_clade_membership=3a2&f_epiweek=202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143&f_region=Africa,Europe,Japan%20Korea,North%20America,Oceania,South%20America,South%20Asia,West%20Asia,Southeast%20Asia&l=scatter&p=full)

In a change from last month when 3a2 in China had the highest LBI, we now see the highest LBI from the globally circulating strains from 3a2.
