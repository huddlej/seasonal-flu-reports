abstract: "Recent submissions from Brazil show circulation of all three major lineages since the start of the pandemic. H3N2 strains from a recent Michigan outbreak were previously missing from analyses because they only have HA (instead of HA and NA). The titer substitution model based on FRA data for H3N2 suggest that the HA1:53G subclade may be slightly antigenically advanced even relative to its ancestors carrying HA1:156S."

# [2a.2 dominates global H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&p=grid&r=division)

Of the 849 strains collected since December 1, 2020, 712 (84%) were from 3C.2a1b.2a.2, 57 (7%) were from 3C.2a1b.2a.1, 51 (6%) were from 3C.2a1b.1a, 22 (3%) were from 3C.2a1b.1b, three were from 3C.3a1, and two were from 3C.2a1b.1.
All A/H3N2 strains observed in the last year except one have mutated to HA1:193S and most (N=821 or 97%) have accumulated a mutation at site HA1:186 from the ancestral genotype (G) to D or S.

# [2a.2 subclade with HA1:156S has split on HA1:53 mutations with geographic structure](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&gt=HA1.156S&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=grid&r=division)

Of the 712 strains in 3C.2a1b.2a.2, 539 (76%) map to a subclade with an HA1:H156S mutation.
This subclade almost immediately diverged into two additional subclades carrying with HA1:D53G (N=280 or 52% of 156S strains) or HA1:D53N (N=248 or 46%) mutations.
These HA1:53 subclades exhibit distinct geographic distributions.
The 53N subclade dominates in South America, West Europe, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, India, Nepal, Singapore, and Australia.
The 53G subclade dominates in the USA, Russia, Lebanon, Austria, and Sweden.

# [2a.2 subclades remain geographically structured even within the United States](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&gt=HA1.156S&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=grid&r=division)

Even within the USA, most states have only strains from one of these subclades.
So far, only Alaska, California, Montana, and Georgia have strains from both subclades.
Notable 2a.2 outbreaks in Michigan and Maryland were primarily driven by 53G strains.
The majority of these strains and those from subsequent transmission in the USA are genetically identical, all sharing putative epitope mutations at HA1:157I and 262N.

# [Recent FRA data detect a slight antigenic advance for 53G over 53N](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=full&r=division)

Although the primary antigenic advance for recent 2a.2 strains corresponds to the 156S subclade (with an antigenic advance of 5.42 log2 titers from the root compared to 4.26 for its immediate ancestor), the 53G subclade has a slightly higher advance of 6.15 log2 titers.

# [Multiple subclades of 2a.2â€™s 156S clade have high local branching index](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=lbi&d=tree&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=full)

These high local branching index (LBI) values appear driven by recent submission of many identical HA sequences in both 53G and 53N subclades.

# [Both forecasting models favor 2a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&d=tree,frequencies&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

Despite favoring the same clade as most representative of the future, the antigenic novelty model predicts that 2a.2 strains are less representative of the future than the LBI model predicts.

# [LBI forecasts slightly prefer 53N, antigenic forecasts favor 2a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

The LBI-based model slightly prefers the 53N subclade, while the antigenic novelty models favors 2a.2 more generally.
The slight antigenic advance of 53G suggested by the titer substitution model does not appear to influence the antigenic novelty model's forecasts.

# [Common mutations associated with egg-passaging may cause antigenic mismatch with circulating strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/egg/fra?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,entropy&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a&m=div&p=full&s=A/Bangladesh/3005/2020,A/Bangladesh/3005/2020-egg,A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020,A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020-egg,A/Darwin/6/2021,A/Darwin/6/2021-egg,A/Darwin/9/2021,A/Darwin/9/2021-egg,A/Michigan/173/2020,A/Michigan/173/2020-egg,A/Tasmania/503/2020,A/Tasmania/503/2020-egg)

These strains carry egg-passaging mutations, including 160K, 183Y, 186N or V or R, 219Y, 225G, that appear to dramatically alter the antigenic profile of the original reference strains.
