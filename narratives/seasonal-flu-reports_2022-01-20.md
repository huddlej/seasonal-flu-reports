abstract: "All three major lineages except B/Yamagata have been observed since the start of the pandemic. A/H3N2 largely consists of one, globally distributed clade (2a.2). The recent Southern Hemisphere vaccine strain, A/Darwin/6/2021, is highly representative, but its egg-passaged strain is likely antigenically mismatched due to passaging mutations. Two main A/H1N1pdm clades, 5a.1 and 5a.2, have circulated in different regions globally at similar frequencies despite 5a.2's greater antigenic advance. Current H1N1pdm vaccine strains are well-matched to recent strains. Of three main B/Victoria clades, only 3a.2 has circulated broadly. Both 3a.1 and a subclade of 3a.2 remain limited to circulation in China. The recent Southern Hemisphere vaccine strain, B/Austria/1359417/2021, is well-matched to recent globally-distributed 3a.2 strains."

# [2a.2 dominates global H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&p=grid&r=division)

Of the 849 strains collected since December 1, 2020:

 - 712 (84%) were from 3C.2a1b.2a.2
 - 57 (7%) were from 3C.2a1b.2a.1
 - 51 (6%) were from 3C.2a1b.1a
 - 22 (3%) were from 3C.2a1b.1b
 - three were from 3C.3a1
 - two were from 3C.2a1b.1

All A/H3N2 strains observed in the last year except one have mutated to HA1:193S and most (N=821 or 97%) have accumulated a mutation at site HA1:186 from the ancestral genotype (G) to D or S.

# [2a.2 subclade with HA1:156S has split on HA1:53 mutations with geographic structure](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&gt=HA1.156S&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=grid&r=division)

Of the 712 strains in 3C.2a1b.2a.2, 539 (76%) map to a subclade with an HA1:H156S mutation.
This subclade almost immediately diverged into two additional subclades carrying with HA1:D53G (N=280 or 52% of 156S strains) or HA1:D53N (N=248 or 46%) mutations.
These HA1:53 subclades exhibit distinct geographic distributions.
The 53N subclade dominates in South America, West Europe, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, India, Nepal, Singapore, and Australia.
The 53G subclade dominates in the USA, Russia, Lebanon, Austria, and Sweden.

# [2a.2 subclades remain geographically structured even within the United States](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&gt=HA1.156S&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=grid&r=division)

Even within the USA, most states have only strains from one of these subclades.
So far, only Alaska, California, Montana, and Georgia have strains from both subclades.
Notable 2a.2 outbreaks in Michigan and Maryland were primarily driven by 53G strains.
The majority of these strains and those from subsequent transmission in the USA are genetically identical, all sharing putative epitope mutations at HA1:157I and 262N.

# [Recent FRA data detect a slight antigenic advance for 53G over 53N](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202202&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=full&r=division)

Measurements from focus reduction assays (FRAs) in ferrets suggest that 53G is slightly more antigenically advanced than 53N.
Although the primary antigenic advance for recent 2a.2 strains corresponds to the 156S subclade (with an antigenic advance of 5.42 log2 titers from the root compared to 4.26 for its immediate ancestor), the 53G subclade has a slightly higher advance of 6.15 log2 titers.

# [Multiple subclades of 2a.2â€™s 156S clade have high local branching index](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=lbi&d=tree&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=full)

These high local branching index (LBI) values appear driven by recent submission of many identical HA sequences in both 53G and 53N subclades.

# [Both forecasting models favor 2a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&d=tree,frequencies&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

Despite favoring the same clade as most representative of the future, the antigenic novelty model predicts that 2a.2 strains are less representative of the future than the LBI model predicts.

# [LBI forecasts slightly prefer 53N, antigenic forecasts favor 2a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&c=gt-HA1_53,156&d=tree&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

The LBI-based model slightly prefers the 53N subclade, while the antigenic novelty models favors 2a.2 more generally.
The slight antigenic advance of 53G suggested by the titer substitution model does not appear to influence the antigenic novelty model's forecasts.

# [Common mutations associated with egg-passaging may cause antigenic mismatch with circulating strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h3n2/ha/2y/egg/fra?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a&m=div&p=full&s=A/Bangladesh/3005/2020,A/Bangladesh/3005/2020-egg,A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020,A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020-egg,A/Darwin/6/2021,A/Darwin/6/2021-egg,A/Darwin/9/2021,A/Darwin/9/2021-egg,A/Michigan/173/2020,A/Michigan/173/2020-egg,A/Tasmania/503/2020,A/Tasmania/503/2020-egg)

These strains carry egg-passaging mutations, including 160K, 183Y, 186N or V or R, 219Y, 225G, that appear to dramatically alter the antigenic profile of the original reference strains.

# [H1N1pdm circulation has been dominated by 5a.1 and 5a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202125&p=grid&r=division)

Both 6B.1A.5a.1 and 6B.1A.5a.2 dominated in the last year, remaining at similar global frequencies during this time.
Interestingly, 6B.1A.7 reemerged at the beginning of the year in Norway, and 6B.1A.1 reemerged in the United States in September 2021.
These two older clades had not been previously observed for over a year, suggesting that they have continued to circulate undetected in these countries.

# [H1N1pdm clades exhibit strong geographic structure](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=map&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202125&p=full&r=division)

H1N1pdm clades exhibit strong geographic structure globally with the exception of Iowa in the United States, Sweden, and India where strains from multiple clades have been observed.
In early 2021, 6B.1A.5a.1 was primarily detected in West Africa including Togo, Niger, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana.
Since then, strains from this clade have been sampled in 11 other countries in 6 of 10 major regions.

# [5a.1 from Africa comprise 196 (66%) of H1N1pdm strains in the last year](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?%3Fd=tree,map,frequencies&d=tree,map&f_clade_membership=6B.1A.5a.1&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202125&f_region=Africa&p=grid&r=division)

# [5a.1 has diverged into two major subclades, one with HA1:166T and 186T mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?%3Fd=tree,map,frequencies&branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_166,186&d=tree,map&f_clade_membership=6B.1A.5a.1&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202125&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.1&p=grid&r=division)

5a.1 has diverged into a subclade with HA1:166T and 186T mutations and another major subclade where the HA reassorted with an NA more closely related to 6B.1A.5a.2's.
The 166T/186T subclade has not been observed outside of West Africa or at all since late July, 2021.
Interestingly, the 166T mutation emerged independently in Colombia without the 186T mutation but with an additional 187S mutation.

# [HA from one 5a.1 subclade reassorted with NA from 5a.2's background](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi:/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/na/2y/cell/hi?c=gt-nuc_899,1250,1310&d=tree&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201&p=full)

Unlike the 166T/186T subclade, the reassorted subclade has spread throughout Africa, Europe, and the United States.

# [5a.2 reemerged in the last year and spread to at least 10 countries](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151,202152,202201,202125&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.2&p=grid&tl=country)

A major subclade of 6B.1A.5a.2 reemerged in India in late 2020, after over a year without observations, with mutations at HA1:K54Q, A186T, Q189E, and E224A.
Initially, this clade primarily circulated in India and Bangladesh.
It has since been observed in 9 additional countries including the USA, Sweden, Denmark, Romania, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Australia.

Two subclades, V1A.3a.1 and V1A.3a.2, comprise recent V1A.3a strains.
V1A.3a.1 is characterized by a HA1:V220M and has circulated almost entirely in China for the last year.
V1A.3a.2 is characterized by a HA1:P144L mutation and has diverged into two distinct subclades.
The first V1A.3a.2 subclade carries a HA1:H122Q mutation and has only circulated in China for the last year, along with V1A.3a.1.
The second V1A.3a.2 subclade has reassorted its HA with an NA from a highly divergent background.

The clade 3a.1 only appears in China, along with a major subclade of 3a.2.
Clades in China appear similarly distributed geographically across most divisions.

# [Circulation in the United States is highly structured](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-01-20/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202117,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150,202151&p=grid&r=division)

In contrast to China, strains in the United States from different clades rarely circulate within the same state.
