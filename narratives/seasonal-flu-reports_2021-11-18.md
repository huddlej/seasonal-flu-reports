# [Recent H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&p=grid)

A1b/159N continues to dominate recent submissions.
These data were collected in primarily North America, Europe, and Russia.
We also see recent data from clades that we previously expected to be extinct including A1b/186D, A1b/135K, and 3c3.A.

# [A1b/159N has diverged into two major subclades at site HA1:53](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_53&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=grid)

We see circulation of 53N in Europe and Australia, while 53G is circulating in the USA and Russia.

# [A1b/135K strains recently reemerged](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_clade_membership=A1b/135K&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/135K&p=grid)

These two strains appear in Oman with three novel amino acid mutations in HA1.

# [156S appears to drive A1b/159N antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree,map&label=clade:A1b/159N&m=div&p=grid)

156S is associated with an increase of ~2-3 log2 titers of antigenic advance based on ferret HI data.
