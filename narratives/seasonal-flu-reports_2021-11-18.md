# [Recent H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&p=grid)

A1b/159N continues to dominate recent submissions.
These data were collected in primarily North America, Europe, and Russia.
We also see recent data from clades that we previously expected to be extinct including A1b/186D, A1b/135K, and 3c3.A.
