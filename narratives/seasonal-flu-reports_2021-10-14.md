title: Seasonal influenza circulation as of October 14, 2021
authors: John Huddleston
date: "October 18, 2021"

abstract: "Seasonal influenza populations circulating since September 1, 2020 generally exhibit reduced numbers, strong geographic structure, convergent evolution, and HA/NA reassortment. Vaccine candidates for A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 target mutually exclusive clades within each subtype, complicating the process of selecting a single vaccine candidate per subtype. A/H3N2 egg-passaged candidates carry multiple amino acid mutations that dramatically reduce antigenicity. Two B/Vic candidates may cover all extant clades."

We've observed most major pre-pandemic clades in the last year.

# [Most H1N1pdm data are from West Africa](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=map&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135&p=full&transmissions=hide&f_region=Africa)

Most strains collected since September 1, 2020 belong to clade A5a.1.
The majority of these strains are from West African countries including Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo.
The remaining strains belong to A5a.2 with samples primarily from India.

Most strains collected since September 1, 2020 belong to clade A5a.1.
The majority of these strains are from West African countries including Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo.
The remaining strains belong to A5a.2 with samples primarily from India.

# [A5a.1 has diverged into two subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_166,186&d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135&label=clade:A5a.1&p=full&transmissions=hide)

A5a.1 has split into two subclades defined by mutations at HA1 positions 166 and 186.
The subclade with HA1:I166T and HA1:A186T has circulated in all five represented West African countries.
The other subclade with the ancestral genotypes at sites 166 (I) and 186 (A) has continued to circulate in all of these African countries and recently appeared in the United States and Qatar.

# [A5a.1's HA reassorted with A5a.2's NA in West Africa](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/ha/2y:/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/na/2y?c=gt-HA1_166,186&d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135&label=clade:A5a.1&p=full&transmissions=hide)

The HA from this subclade has reassorted with an NA (carrying a T16A mutation) from the A5a.2 background.

# [A5a.2 recently reemerged in India](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135&label=clade:A5a.2&p=grid&transmissions=hide)

Most of the remaining A/H1N1pdm strains belong to A5a.2 with observations in the United States, Ghana, China, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, and India.
The most recent of these strains form a subclade circulating in India between May and August 2021 and carry HA1:K54Q, A186T, Q189E, and E224A mutations.
One strain from this subclade was collected in Australia from a known travel case.
The recent reemergence of A5a.2 strains in India suggests that A/H1N1pdm has continued to circulate and evolve locally.

# [A5a.2 is most antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?c=cTiterSub&d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135&p=full&transmissions=hide)

Both titer models (tree and substitution) identify A5a.2 as more antigenically advanced than other clades.

# [A5a.1 has the highest LBI with A5a.2 close behind](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135&p=full&transmissions=hide)

A5a.1 has the highest LBI despite its lower antigenic advance.
Recent strains from India have boosted the LBI of A5a.2, however.

We have observed four pre-pandemic clades in the last year including A1b/94N, A1b/137F, A1b/186D, and 3c3.A.
The majority of recent strains belong to A1b/94N subclades, A1b/159N and A1b/186S.

A1b/159N has circulated in every major continental region except for South America with primary circulation in Bangladesh and India.
In contrast, A1b/186S has circulated primarily in Southeast Asia and Oceania with fewer observations in Japan, the United States, and Côte d'Ivoire.
A1b/186D has circulated almost exclusively in West Africa in the last year with only one strain collected elsewhere (A/Grenoble/2789/2020).

Similarly, the first 3c3.A strain observed in 17 months was collected in Australia in May 2021 and carried five amino acid mutations including three in HA1.
These patterns indicate that major A/H3N2 clades have continued to circulate and evolve locally.

We have observed four pre-pandemic clades in the last year including A1b/94N, A1b/137F, A1b/186D, and 3c3.A.
The majority of recent strains belong to A1b/94N subclades, A1b/159N and A1b/186S.

All A/H3N2 strains observed in the last year except one have mutated to HA1:193S and nearly all have accumulated a mutation at site HA1:186 from the ancestral genotype (G) to D, S, A, and R.

# [A1b/94N has diverged into two subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202140&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=full&transmissions=hide)

The subclade of A1b/94N carrying HA1:F193S and Y195F mutations has diverged into two large subclades designated here as A1b/159N and A1b/186S.
These clades carry the following HA1 mutations:

  * A1b/159N: **Y159N**, *T160I*, L164Q, G186D, D190N
  * A1b/186S: G186S

The 159N mutation occurred at a previously confirmed epitope position adjacent to the receptor binding site (RBS, Koel et al. 2013), but viruses with asparagine at this position have not circulated in significant numbers since 1968.
The 160I mutation removes a glycosylation site that has shielded other epitopes in 3c2.A strains for the last eight years (Zost et al. 2017).

# [A1b/159N subclades carry additional RBS-adjacent mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_156&d=tree&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202140&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=full&transmissions=hide)

Additionally, two subclades of A1b/159N carry different HA1:156 mutations adjacent to the RBS including a H156S (in India, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Qatar, the Philippines, and Russia) and H156Q (in Kenya, India, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States).

# [Subclades of 186D exhibit geographic structure](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_54,130,131&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202140&f_region=Africa&m=div&p=grid&transmissions=hide&label=clade:A1b/186D)

Subclades of 186D exhibit strong geographic structure and convergent evolution at an epitope site (HA1:131).
HA1:T131I emerged independently in Niger and Cameroon, while HA1:T131N and HA1:N131K both emerged in the Republic of the Congo.
These patterns could represent successful pandemic interventions that limit travel between countries and the evolution of A/H3N2 to escape local immunity with similar historical infection histories in the region.

# [Both titer- and LBI-based models forecast growth of 159N](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-14/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&l=scatter&m=div&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi&transmissions=hide)

Both models predict that A1b/159N strains the closest representatives of future H3N2 populations.
These predictions represent higher antigenic advance and higher LBI of 159N strains compared to other clades.

3a1 has circulated almost entirely in China with two strains observed in Russia.
With the exception of a single A/H1N1pdm strain, 3a1 represents the only influenza data collected in China since last September.
Although few amino acid mutations have emerged in 3a1, we observed recurrent HA1:R80K mutations in three subclades and two separate mutations at HA1:122 (H122N and H122Q)

3a2 is globally distributed with observations in North America, Africa, Europe, West Asia, Southeast Asia, and China.
The 3a2 strains from China all belong to a single clade with the same HA1:H122Q mutation that appeared independently in the 3a1 clade in China.
This HA1:122Q subclade has circulated entirely in China where it has multiple strains with a HA1:-165N insertion, possibly representing convergent evolution.

Outside of China, 3a2 strains exhibit geographic structure.
Subclades with HA1:A202V have emerged independently in South Africa and Bangladesh, with apparent onward transmission from Bangladesh to Singapore.
Another subclade with HA1:T182A, D197E, and T221A mutations has circulated primarily in West Africa and France with some onward transmission to the United States, Austria, and Russia.

3a2 strains circulating outside of China (denoted by nucleotide mutation A1382G) have reassorted with a NA from a separate V1A lineage from all other extant NAs.
These patterns are consistent with moderate geographic restrictions associated with the pandemic outside of China and much stronger restrictions between China and the rest of the world.
