date: "October 18, 2022"

abstract: In H1N1pdm, 5a.2 appears to be outcompeting other subclades, but there is little signal within this clade of successful emerging clades except perhaps those with HA1:137S or HA1:216A mutations. Multiple H3N2 clades continue to compete globally, complicating predictions. In Vic, 3a.2 continues to dominate, although a recent subclade of V1A.3 strains in the Netherlands appeared to temporarily outcompete 3a.2 until recently.

# [Most lineages have not returned to pre-pandemic levels](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree&p=full)

Although H3N2 has circulated above pre-pandemic levels, B/Yam has gone extinct and neither A/H1N1pdm nor B/Vic have returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The 220 genomes submitted in the last month map to the following clades:

 * 5a.2: 146 (66%) in South Asia, Africa, Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America.
 * 5a.1: 74 (34%) in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania.

Despite representing 88% of recent global sequences, 5a.2 remains dominant primarily in Oceania, South Asia, and Africa with a slightly higher frequency in North America.
5a.1 retains a higher frequency in South America and Europe.

5a.2 is the most antigenically advanced by the substitution model.
There is little variation in advance within 5a.2 subclade, however, despite the number amino acid mutations there.

5a.2 is the most antigenically advanced by the tree model, too, although we see a slightly higher variation within the clade.

Within 5a.2, subclades with 216A and 137S appear slightly more advanced than their sibling clades.

# [HA1:142R and 137S mutations are at putative epitope sites](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree&p=full&branchLabel=aa&c=ep&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202240&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.2)

In the absence of strong antigenic data from the ferret serology, one might conclude that these two epitope mutations might favor this subclade over others.

The highest LBI appears in a subclade of 5a.2 that has circulated primarily in Australia (New South Wales) and New Zealand.

5a.1 has a moderately high LBI, too, driven by a subclade that has circulated in almost every European country as well as North America, South America, southern Africa, and
Oceania.
This subclade has no HA1 mutations, but it does have a NA:S366N mutation.

# [Most recent H3N2 is also from Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree&p=full)

The 323 genomes submitted in the last month map to the following clades:

* 53N: 134 (41%) from 6 major regions (notably not Oceania)
* 53G: 71 (22%) from 7 major regions
* 2a.1: 55 (17%) from China
* 50K: 35 (11%) from North and South America, Africa, and Europe
* 2a.2: 27 (8%) from 6 major regions
* 1a: 1 (<1%) from Qatar

# [Recent H3N2 circulation in 2022](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202233,202235,202236,202237,202232,202234&p=grid)

53G and 53N now circulate at equal frequencies (~28%) and continue to exhibit distinct circulation with 53G primarily in North America, Europe, and Oceania and 53N in South America, Africa, and South/Southeast Asia.

50K frequency dropped for the first time from 18% to 16%, suggesting it may have peaked; we cannot rule out effects of submission delays on these frequencies, though.
50K appears in four major regions with highest circulation in North America and Europe followed by South America and Africa.

The most recent 2a.1 circulation remains limited to China and represents 14% of global H3N2.

The substitution model assigns the most antigenic advance to the 53G clade.
This clade has a bimodal distribution of antigenic advance.

The most antigenically advanced tips have the HA1:157I mutation.
That specific pattern remains driven by titer measurements from the A/Maryland/2/2021 reference sera.

The tree model does not distinguish as much between any of the recent clades, although 53G and 53N have a slightly higher mean antigenic advance.
A subset of both 53N and 50K strains appear advanced relative to the rest of the strains in these clades.

The most advanced subclade of 53N has additional 50K and 83K mutations.
The 53N subclade with both 50K and 140K mutations is not considered as advanced by this model.

# [H3N2 antigenic advance by tree model](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?branches=hide&d=tree&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202235,202236,202237,202234&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2/50K&p=full&scatterX=cTiter&scatterY=clade_membership&c=gt-HA1_242&branchLabel=none)

The most advanced subclade of 50K does _not_ have an additional 242M mutation.

# [H3N2 local branching index](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?c=lbi&d=tree,map&p=grid&r=division&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202233,202235,202236,202237,202232,202234)

53G has the highest LBI with the highest values in a 104G subclade that circulated in Europe in through June and in Australia and New Zealand through August.

# [H3N2 forecasts](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,frequencies&p=full&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

The model based on antigenic novelty with FRA titers and the model based on LBI favor distinctly different clades.
The antigenic novelty model favors the growth of 2a.1, given its slight antigenic advance and high antigenic novelty compared to the rest of the 2a.2 clades that have circulated recently.
However, as long as 2a.1 circulation remains limited to China, this growth is unlikely to be observed globally.

In contrast, the LBI model favors the growth of 53G, followed by the rest of the 2a.2 subclades.

# [H3N2 forecasts](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,frequencies&p=full&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi&f_clade_membership=3C.2a1b.2a.2,3C.2a1b.2a.2/50K,3C.2a1b.2a.2/53G,3C.2a1b.2a.2/53N)

Assuming that 2a.1 circulation remains limited to China and focusing on the remaining 2a.2 clades, the antigenic novelty model predicts the continued growth of 53G and 50K and the decline of 53N.

The 142 genomes submitted in the last month map to the following clades:

 * 3a.2: 138 (97%) from every major region except Japan/Korea with most recently collected samples from Southeast Asia, China, Africa, and Europe.
 * V1A.3: 4 (3%) from Spain, Germany, and China.

# [Recent Vic circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235&p=grid&transmissions=hide)

3a.2 appears to have outcompeted 3a.1 in China, eliminating it globally.
Other V1A.3 subclades have doubled in frequency in the last month from 12% to 24% of samples collected in 2022.
These subclades are directly competing with 3a.2 in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Madagascar, and China, but total counts remain too low to estimate fitness differences between these strains.

With 60 samples from 3a.2 or V1A.3, the Netherlands has the most samples of any country to compare fitness differences of these strains.
From these samples, 3a.2 appears to be outcompeting its sibling V1A.3 strains.
No specific subclade of 3a.2 has dominated in the Netherlands recently, however, so the amino acid mutation(s) responsible for any specific fitness advantage in this clade are unclear.

3a.2 is the most antigenically advanced clade by the substitution model.

Although 3a.2 also has the highest antigenic advance from the tree model, this model detects a subset of antigenically advanced strains in V1A.3, too.

On inspection, the tips that get additional antigenic weight were those with a HA1:184R mutation that have been collected in the Netherlands and Spain.
Notably, of the other 7 related tips that do _not_ get any additional antigenic weight from the model, 6 have an additional HA1 mutation of either I318V or D129N.

These results suggest that the original 184R subclade may have been antigenically advanced and, therefore, successful, but that subsequent mutations in HA1 have reduced the original fitness of the subclade.

# [HA1:129N was the globally dominant allele for a decade](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/flu/seasonal/vic/ha/60y?c=gt-HA1_129&d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

Starting in 2004, HA1:129N was the dominant allele at that site until 2014 when it was replaced by 129D.

A 3a.2 subclade with HA1:197E has some of the highest LBI values from strains circulating in 2022.
The 122Q subclade of 3a.2 also retains a high LBI, despite its circulation in only China.
