title: "Nextstrain seasonal influenza report for October 2022"
date: "October 18, 2022"
dataset: https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree&p=full
abstract: In H1N1pdm, 5a.2 appears to be outcompeting other subclades, but there is little signal within this clade of successful emerging clades except perhaps those with HA1:137S or HA1:216A mutations. Multiple H3N2 clades continue to compete globally, complicating predictions. In Vic, 3a.2 continues to dominate, although a recent subclade of V1A.3 strains in the Netherlands appeared to temporarily outcompete 3a.2 until recently.

# [Most lineages have not returned to pre-pandemic levels](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree&p=full)

Although H3N2 has circulated above pre-pandemic levels, B/Yam has gone extinct and neither A/H1N1pdm nor B/Vic have returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Note that GISAID submissions lag by 2-3 months on average from collection date.

5a.2 represents 86% of recent global sequences and dominates 5a.1 in Oceania, South Asia, Africa, and North America.
5a.1 retains a higher frequency in South America and Europe.

# [The USA has experienced much recent H1N1pdm diversity](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202240&label=clade:6B.1A.5a&p=grid&r=division)

Since January 2022, the USA has sampled much of the extant diversity of H1N1pdm.
Samples collected from 5a.2 are especially diverse across the country.

# [Numerous mutations have emerged in 5a.2 since the last vaccine](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?branchLabel=aa&c=haplotype&d=tree&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.2&p=full)

Over a dozen new HA1 mutations have merged in 5a.2 since the last vaccine strains were selected (A/Victoria/2570/2019 and A/Wisconsin/588/2019).
[The WHO updated the southern hemisphere vaccine this September to A/Sydney/5/2021](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2023-southern-hemisphere-influenza-season) to genetically match current strains.

Nextstrain estimates antigenic advance with two different models that map antigenic weights to branches of a tree (with the "tree model") or amino acids in a multiple sequence alignment (with the "substitution model").
See [Neher et al. 2016](https://bedford.io/papers/neher-titers/) for more details.

5a.2 is the most antigenically advanced by the tree model.
There is little variation in advance within 5a.2 subclade, however, despite the number amino acid mutations there.

5a.2 is the most antigenically advanced by the tree model.
There is little variation in advance within 5a.2 subclade, however, despite the number amino acid mutations there.

# [HA1:142R and 137S mutations are at putative epitope sites](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree&p=full&branchLabel=aa&c=ep&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202240&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.2)

In the absence of strong antigenic data from the ferret serology, one might conclude that these two epitope mutations might favor this subclade over others.

The highest LBI appears in a subclade of 5a.2 that has circulated primarily in Australia (New South Wales) and New Zealand.

5a.1 has a moderately high LBI, too, driven by a subclade that has circulated in almost every European country as well as North America, South America, southern Africa, and
Oceania.
This subclade has no HA1 mutations, but it does have a NA:S366N mutation.

# [Most recent H3N2 is also from Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree&p=full)

Early 2022 samples show epidemics in Europe, North America, and Oceania.

# [Recent H3N2 circulation in 2022](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202233,202235,202236,202237,202232,202234&p=grid)

53G and 53N now circulate at equal frequencies (~26%) and continue to exhibit distinct circulation with 53G primarily in North America, Europe, and Oceania and 53N in South America, Africa, and South/Southeast Asia.

The reassorted 50K clade now represents 25% of global H3N2.
This clade appears in four major regions with highest circulation in North America and Europe followed by South America and Africa.

Recent 2a.1 circulation remains limited to China and represents 9% of global H3N2.

# [The USA has also seen most of H3N2 diversity in 2022](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?p=grid&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&r=division&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202233,202235,202236,202237,202232,202234)

Since January 2022, the USA has sampled most of H3N2's diversity, too, with the exception of 2a.1 which is only circulating in China.
Importantly, the reassorted 50K subclade has been growing here quickly and has been observed in 13 states, predominantly in the eastern USA.

# [H3N2 antigenic advance by tree model](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?branches=hide&d=tree&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202235,202236,202237,202234&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2&p=full&scatterX=cTiter&scatterY=clade_membership&c=clade_membership&branchLabel=none)

The tree model does not distinguish as much between any of the recent clades, although 53G and 53N have a slightly higher mean antigenic advance.
A subset of both 53N and 50K strains appear advanced relative to the rest of the strains in these clades.

# [H3N2 local branching index](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?c=lbi&d=tree&r=division&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202233,202235,202236,202237,202232,202234)

53G has the highest LBI with the highest values in a 104G subclade that circulated in Europe in through June and in Australia and New Zealand through August.

# [H3N2 forecasts](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,frequencies&p=full&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

The model based on antigenic novelty with FRA titers and the model based on LBI favor distinctly different clades.
The antigenic novelty model favors the growth of 2a.1, given its slight antigenic advance and high antigenic novelty compared to the rest of the 2a.2 clades that have circulated recently.
However, as long as 2a.1 circulation remains limited to China, this growth is unlikely to be observed globally.

In contrast, the LBI model favors the growth of 53G, followed by the rest of the 2a.2 subclades.

See [Huddleston et al. 2020](https://bedford.io/papers/huddleston-flu-forecasting/), for more details about these forecasting models.

# [H3N2 forecasts](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,frequencies&p=full&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi&f_clade_membership=3C.2a1b.2a.2,3C.2a1b.2a.2/50K,3C.2a1b.2a.2/53G,3C.2a1b.2a.2/53N)

Assuming that 2a.1 circulation remains limited to China and focusing on the remaining 2a.2 clades, the antigenic novelty model predicts the continued growth of 50K, the decline of 53N, and persistence of 53G.

# [Vic has circulated at low levels in most regions](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree&p=full)

Most Vic samples from the last year were collected in China, but we've seen recent spikes in Europe and continued low-level circulation globally.

3a.2 appears to have outcompeted 3a.1 in China, eliminating it globally.
Other V1A.3 subclades have doubled in frequency in the last month from 12% to 24% of samples collected in 2022.
These subclades are directly competing with 3a.2 in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Madagascar, and China, but total counts remain too low to estimate fitness differences between these strains.

# [3a.2 may be outcompeting V1A.3 in the Netherlands](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree,frequencies&f_country=Netherlands&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235&p=full)

With 60 samples from 3a.2 or V1A.3, the Netherlands has the most samples of any country to compare fitness differences of these strains.
From these samples, 3a.2 appears to be outcompeting its sibling V1A.3 strains.
No specific subclade of 3a.2 has dominated in the Netherlands recently, however, so the amino acid mutation(s) responsible for any specific fitness advantage in this clade are unclear.

# [Vic has been rare in the USA in 2022](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-10-18/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?c=haplotype&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=grid&r=division&f_epiweek=202201,202202,202203,202204,202205,202206,202207,202208,202209,202210,202211,202212,202213,202214,202215,202216,202217,202218,202219,202220,202221,202222,202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235)

Only 6 Vic genomes have been collected in the USA in 2022, all belonging to the 3a.2 subclade.
This same clade is covered by the most recent vaccine, B/Austria/1359417/2021.
Two genomes collected in Montana represent an introduction from China's 122Q subclade.

A 3a.2 subclade with HA1:197E has some of the highest LBI values from strains circulating in 2022.
The 122Q subclade of 3a.2 also retains a high LBI, despite its circulation in only China.

## Conclusions

  - In H1N1pdm, 5a.2 appears to be outcompeting other subclades, but there is little signal within this clade of successful emerging clades except perhaps those with HA1:137S or HA1:216A mutations.
    - The current northern hemisphere vaccine appears well-matched by ferret serology, but the southern hemisphere has updated its vaccine to a better genetic match.
  - Multiple H3N2 clades continue to compete globally, complicating predictions.
    - 2a.1 is antigenically distinct from current vaccine strain, but may only circulate in China.
    - 2a.2 clades appear generally similar by ferret serology, but 2a.2/50K may have an advantage due to reassortment
    - 2a.2/50K is not as closely matched with the H3N2 vaccine strain
  - In Vic, 3a.2 continues to dominate, although a recent subclade of V1A.3 strains in the Netherlands appeared to temporarily outcompete 3a.2 until recently.
    - The USA has seen little Vic except a handful of 3a.2 strains.
    - The current vaccine strain covers 3a.2 well.
