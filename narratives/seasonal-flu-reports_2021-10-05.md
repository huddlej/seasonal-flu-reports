# [All recent H3N2 strains belong to 94N subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-01/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

A1b/186S strains all originate from Laos.
A1b/159N strains are globally distributed with some back-filled strains from late 2020/early 2021 in India.

# [Recent A1b/159N strains map to 156S subclade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-01/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=grid)

A1b/159N strains submitted in the last week map to a subclade with a HA1:156S mutation and subclades with HA1:D53N and G mutations.
Strains were collected in the USA, Russia, Spain, and the Netherlands.

# [156S mutation is associated with antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-01/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

A1b/159N strains with the 156S mutation have higher antigenic advance than other recent strains.

# [Recent B/Vic strains belong to 3a subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-01/vic/ha/2y?f_recency=last%20week&p=grid&&d=tree,map)

In the last week, 104 new strains were submitted all from either China or Bangladesh.
Circulation of 3a1 remains limited to China for now.

# [B/Vic 3a2 subclade with 122Q mutation remains in China](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-10-01/vic/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=region&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:3a2&p=grid)

Circulation of 3a2 strains with 122Q mutations remains limited to China.
All other 3a2 strains outside of China originate from Bangladesh.
