# [Seasonal influenza circulation since 2018](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

To understand global seasonal influenza circulation, we build phylogenies of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) using data submitted to [GISAID](http://gisaid.org/).
Seasonal influenza consists of four major lineages including:

 - A/H3N2 ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/na/2y/cell/fra))
 - A/H1N1pdm ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h1n1pdm/na/2y/cell/hi))
 - B/Victoria (Vic) ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/vic/na/2y/cell/hi))
 - B/Yamagata (Yam) ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/yam/ha/2y), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/yam/na/2y))

The global response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic substantially reduced seasonal influenza circulation following April 2020.
The B/Yamagata lineage has not been observed since March 2020, indicating that the pandemic might have eliminated one of the major influenza lineages.
Only A/H3N2 appears to have returned to pre-pandemic levels of circulation.

# [Viruses accumulate mutations along transmission trees](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

Transmission trees represent the actual infection of individuals and subsequent onward transmission from each infection.
We can sample the genomes of some (often small) proportion of all infections.
Viral genomes accumulate mutations during replication, allowing us to infer the transmission tree.

Phylogenetic trees represent the inferred relationships between sampled virus genomes.
Phylogenetic algorithms rely on the shared mutations present in the sampled genomes to infer these relationships.

# [Clades represent potentially relevant biological or epidemiological groups ](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

Viral genomes that share a single common ancestor in a phylogeny are called "clades".
We define a clade by the mutations that we find in its inferred ancestral genome.
These clades may represent viruses with similar phenotypes or geographic distributions.

Each blue subtree in the left and center panels of the figure above represents a clade in the corresponding tree.

# [H3N2 diversity in the last four years](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

At the beginning of the pandemic, most H3N2 clades descended from the 3C.2a1b clade.
The clade 3C.3a is a notable exception, a distantly related sibling clade that had circulated at low frequency since late 2013 (7 years).
Most of the clades circulating as of January 2020 were replaced by a new clade 2a.2.

# [H3N2 circulation dropped following global pandemic responses](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=none&d=tree&dmin=2020-01-01&p=full)

In January 2020, all major clades circulated globally.
By April 2020, almost all clades had disappeared from genome surveillance data.
The reappearance of major clades later in 2020 indicates ongoing, unobserved transmission despite global pandemic responses.

# [H3N2 circulation during the pandemic shows regional structure](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&dmin=2020-04-01&p=grid&r=region&transmissions=hide)

H3N2 clades show limited geographic distributions throughout the pandemic.
For example, Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America all exhibit distinct patterns of clades circulating in the last two years.
