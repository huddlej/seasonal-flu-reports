# [Seasonal influenza circulation since 2018](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

To understand global seasonal influenza circulation, we build phylogenies of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) using data submitted to [GISAID](http://gisaid.org/).
Seasonal influenza consists of four major lineages including:

 - A/H3N2 ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/na/2y/cell/fra))
 - A/H1N1pdm ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h1n1pdm/na/2y/cell/hi))
 - B/Victoria (Vic) ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/vic/na/2y/cell/hi))
 - B/Yamagata (Yam) ([HA tree](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/yam/ha/2y), [NA tree](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/yam/na/2y))

The global response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic substantially reduced seasonal influenza circulation following April 2020.
The B/Yamagata lineage has not been observed since March 2020, indicating that the pandemic might have eliminated one of the major influenza lineages.
Only A/H3N2 appears to have returned to pre-pandemic levels of circulation.

Most of the clades circulating as of January 2020 were replaced by a new clade 2a.2.
