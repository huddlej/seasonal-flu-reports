# [Seasonal influenza circulation since 2018](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-05-31/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,frequencies&p=full)

Seasonal influenza lineages consist of A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm, B/Victoria (Vic), and B/Yamagata (Yam).
Nextstrain analyses rely on data submitted to GISAID to reconstruct patterns of recent influenza circulation globally.
