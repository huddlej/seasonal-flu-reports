abstract: B/Vic has been rare in the USA. In H1N1pdm, 5a.2 is outcompeting other subclades with a subclade carrying HA1:142R and either HA1:137S or HA1:216A mutations driving recent growth. The reassorted H3N2 subclade 2a.2/50K continues to grow rapidly and is now the dominant clade globally.

# [Recent Vic circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&p=grid)

3a.2 is the dominate clade globally, although sibling clades of the ancestral V1A.3a clade with HA1:133R or HA1:128K and 155A mutations continue to circulate at low levels.

# [Vic has been rare in the USA since June 2022](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?c=haplotype&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=grid&r=division)

Only 2 Vic genomes have been collected in the USA since June 2022, all belonging to the 3a.2 subclade.

# [Vic samples in the USA have similar antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?c=cTiter&d=tree&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=full&r=division)

The two Vic samples have similar antigenic advance values as each other and their sibling clades.

# [Vic with HA1:197E mutation has the highest local branching index](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/vic/2y/cell/hi/ha?c=lbi&d=tree&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=full&r=division)

The sample collected in Delaware belongs to a subclade with a HA1:197E mutation that has the highest local branching index of recent Vic samples.

# [Recent H1N1pdm circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243&label=clade:6B.1A.5a&p=grid)

5a.2 dominates recent global sequences, although 5a.1 has been the dominant clade in Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina, Zambia, Kenya, and France.

# [Since June, 5a.2 has dominated in the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?c=haplotype&d=tree,map,frequencies&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.2&p=grid&r=division)

Since June 2022, the USA has sampled much of the extant diversity of 5a.2.
Subclades with HA1:142R and either HA1:137S or HA1:216A mutations are at the highest frequencies.

# [Models show antigenic advance in recent subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/h1n1pdm/2y/cell/hi/ha?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiter&d=tree&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243&label=clade:6B.1A.5a.2&p=full&r=division)

Recent subclades with the HA1:142R plus 137S or 216A show a 2-fold antigenic advance relative to ancestral clades.

# [Recent H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a&p=grid)

Multiple subclades of 2a.2 and a subclade of 2a.1 have been circulating globally since June 2022.
With 2a.1 circulation currently limited to China, most focus has been on 2a.2 subclades including 53G, 53N, and a reassorted clade 50K.
50K has been growing quickly and has recently become the highest frequency clade.

# [The USA has also seen most of H3N2 diversity since June 2022](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?c=haplotype&d=tree,map,frequencies&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=grid&r=division)

Since June 2022, the USA has sampled most of H3N2's diversity.
Although numerous derived haplotypes from each major clade have circulated in the country, a common pattern is the recurrence of 50K and 140K mutations against multiple backgrounds.

# [50K is more antigenically novel than other 2a.2 subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-11-17/h3n2/2y/cell/fra/ha?branches=hide&d=tree,frequencies&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202223,202224,202225,202226,202227,202228,202229,202230,202231,202232,202233,202234,202235,202236,202237,202238,202239,202240,202241,202242,202243,202244&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full&r=division&scatterX=cTiter_x&scatterY=clade_membership)

Models based on ferret serological data find that 50K is more antigenically novel than other 2a.2 subclades, leading forecasts based on this metric to favor 50K's growth in the next year.

## Conclusions

  - B/Vic has been rare in the USA.
  - In H1N1pdm, 5a.2 is outcompeting other subclades with a subclade carrying HA1:142R and either HA1:137S or HA1:216A mutations driving recent growth.
  - The reassorted H3N2 subclade 2a.2/50K continues to grow rapidly and is now the dominant clade globally.
