abstract: "Seasonal influenza populations circulating since September 1, 2020 generally exhibit reduced numbers, strong geographic structure, convergent evolution, and HA/NA reassortment. Vaccine candidates for A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 target mutually exclusive clades within each subtype, complicating the process of selecting a single vaccine candidate per subtype. A/H3N2 egg-passaged candidates carry multiple amino acid mutations that dramatically reduce antigenicity. Two B/Vic candidates may cover all extant clades."

We've observed most major pre-pandemic clades in the last year including 6b1.A/187A, 6b1.A/183P-5a, 6b1.A/156K, 6b1.A/183P-5b, and 6b1.A/183P-7.

# [Most H1N1pdm data are from West Africa](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=map&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202130,202131&f_region=Africa&label=clade:6b1.A/187A&p=full&transmissions=hide)

Of the 222 strains collected since September 1, 2020, 195 (88%) are from 6b1.A/187A and 187 (96%) of these are from West African countries including CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo.

# [Three main clades dominate](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202130,202131&p=full)

Most recent 187A strains belong to one of two subclades defined by mutations at HA1 positions 166 and 186.
The subclade with HA1:I166T and HA1:A186T has circulated in all five represented West African countries and corresponds to half of recent 187A strains.
The other 187A subclade with the ancestral genotypes at sites 166 (I) and 186 (A) has continued to circulate in all of these African countries except Ghana and recently appeared in the United States.

# [187A's HA reassorted with 156K's NA in West Africa](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/na/2y/cell/hi?d=tree&f_clade_membership=6b1.A/156K,6b1.A/186T,6b1.A/187A&p=full&transmissions=hide)

Notably, the HA from this subclade has [reassorted with an NA (carrying a T16A mutation) from the 6b1.A/156K background](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi:/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/na/2y/cell/hi?d=tree&f_clade_membership=6b1.A/156K,6b1.A/186T,6b1.A/187A&p=full&transmissions=hide).
An additional mutation at HA1:T232I appeared recently in this subclade in Togo.

# [156K recently reemerged in India](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map&f_clade_membership=6b1.A/156K&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202130,202131&m=div&p=grid)

Most of the remaining A/H1N1pdm strains (N=17 or 8%) belong to 6b1.A/156K with observations in the United States, Ghana, China, Indonesia, New Zealand, and India.
The most recent of these strains form a subclade circulating in India between May and August 2021 (N=16) and carry HA1:K54Q, A186T, Q189E, and E224A mutations.
Within this subclade, another subclade carries HA1:R259K and K308R mutations.
One strain from the United States, A/Iowa/2/2021, carries a notable mutation at HA1:K156Q.
The recent reemergence of 156K strains in India suggests that A/H1N1pdm has continued to circulate and evolve locally.

# [156K is most antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202130,202131&l=scatter&p=full&scatterX=cTiterSub&scatterY=cTiter)

Both titer models (tree and substitution) identify 156K as more antigenically advanced than other 187A and 186T.
The US strains with HA1:G155E and A187S mutations are most advanced of the non-156K strains.

# [187A and its subclades have the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=lbi&d=tree&f_epiweek=202036,202038,202039,202040,202041,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202049,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202130,202131&p=full)

187A and 186T have the highest LBI, despite their lower antigenic advance than 156K.
This mismatch between ferret HI and LBI could indicate a mismatch between human and naive ferret immunity. 

# [No candidates cover both 187A and 156K strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi)

The previous vaccine strain, A/Hawaii/70/2019, and a more recent candidate strain from the 6b1.A/186T clade, A/Togo/881/2020, are antigenically well-matched to 6b1.A/187A viruses.
However, recent viruses from 6b1.A/156K have ~5-fold reduced titers against sera from A/Hawaii/70/2019.
We observe the opposite pattern for sera against the current vaccine strain, A/Wisconsin/588/2019.
These sera effectively inhibit recent 6b1.A/156K strains but not 6b1.A/187A strains.

# [Egg-passaged strains are qualitatively similar to cell-passaged strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/egg/hi)

HI data for sera raised against egg-grown viruses look qualitatively similar.
A clear exception is the egg-passaged strain of A/Togo/881/2020 that fails to produce sera that inhibit 187A strains.
The egg-passaged strain has picked up a HA1:N162H mutation missing in the wild-type strain that could be associated with this antigenic mismatch.
Covering 6b1.A/187A and 6b1.A/156K viruses appears to be mutually exclusive.

We have observed four pre-pandemic clades in the last year including A1b/94N, A1b/137F, A1b/186D, and 3c3.A.
Of the 345 strains collected since September 1, 2020, 282 (82%) were from A1b/94N, 58 (17%) were from A1b/186D, four (1%) were from 137F, and one was from 3c3.A.

# [All extant strains but one carry 193S and 186 mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=gt-HA1_186,193&d=tree&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131&p=full)

All A/H3N2 strains observed in the last year except one have mutated to HA1:193S and nearly all (N=339 or 98%) have accumulated a mutation at site HA1:186 from the ancestral genotype (G) to D (N=252), S (N=85), A (N=1), and R (N=1).

# [94N has diverged into two subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=full)

The subclade of A1b/94N carrying HA1:F193S and Y195F mutations has diverged into two large subclades designated here as A1b/159N and A1b/186S.
These clades carry the following HA1 mutations:

  * A1b/159N: **Y159N**, *T160I*, L164Q, G186D, D190N
  * A1b/186S: G186S

The 159N mutation occurred at a previously confirmed epitope position adjacent to the receptor binding site (RBS, Koel et al. 2013), but viruses with asparagine at this position have not circulated in significant numbers since 1968.

# [A1b/159N lost a glycosylation site associated with 3c2.A for 8 years](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_160&d=tree&p=full)

The 160I mutation removes a glycosylation site that has shielded other epitopes in 3c2.A strains for the last eight years (Zost et al. 2017).

# [A1b/159N subclades carry additional RBS-adjacent mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_156&d=tree&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=full)

Additionally, two subclades of A1b/159N carry different HA1:156 mutations adjacent to the RBS including a H156S (in India, Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Russia) and H156Q (in Kenya, India, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States).

# [94N subclades have different geographic distributions](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&d=map&f_clade_membership=A1b/159N,A1b/186S&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=full&transmissions=hide)

A1b/159N has circulated in every major continental region except for South America with primary circulation in Bangladesh and India.
In contrast, A1b/186S has circulated primarily in Southeast Asia and Oceania with fewer observations in Japan, the United States, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire.

# [A1b/186D is almost exclusively in West Africa](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&f_clade_membership=A1b/186D&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131&p=grid&transmissions=hide)

A1b/186D has circulated almost exclusively in West Africa in the last year with only one strain collected elsewhere (A/Grenoble/2789/2020).

# [Subclades of 186D exhibit geographic structure](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_54,130,131&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202037,202038,202039,202040,202041,202042,202043,202044,202045,202046,202047,202048,202049,202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131&label=clade:A1b/186D&m=div&p=grid&transmissions=hide)

Subclades of 186D exhibit strong geographic structure and convergent evolution at an epitope site (HA1:131).
HA1:T131I emerged independently in Niger and Cameroon, while HA1:T131N and HA1:N131K both emerged in the Republic of the Congo.
These patterns could represent successful pandemic interventions that limit travel between countries and the evolution of A/H3N2 to escape local immunity with similar historical infection histories in the region.

Similarly, the first 3c3.A strain observed in 17 months was collected in Australia in May 2021 and carried five amino acid mutations including three in HA1.
These patterns indicate that major A/H3N2 clades have continued to circulate and evolve locally.
As pandemic restrictions relax, these clades may reemerge and compete globally with the current dominant subclades of A1b/94N.
Inter-continental travel volume will likely remain low through the 21/22 winter such that strong geographical differences might persist.

# [H3N2 vaccine candidates don't cover both 94N subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports@main/flu/seasonal/2021-09-03/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra)

Sera raised against both the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strain, A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020, and the Southern Hemisphere cell-grown vaccine strain, A/HongKong/45/2019, inhibit recently circulating strains from the A1b/94N subclade A1b/186S.
Additionally, sera against A/HongKong/45/2019 appear to strongly inhibit recent strains from A1b/137F and A1b/186D.
Recent candidate strains A/Pennsylvania/1026/2019 (A1b/137F), A/NewYork/21/2020 (A1b/186D), and A/Tasmania/503/2020 (A1b/186S) show similar patterns.
As expected, A/Tasmania/503/2020 strongly inhibits other strains from A1b/186S.
However, recent A1b/159N strains have ~2-5-fold reduced titers against these sera.

In contrast, sera raised against A1b/159N strains strongly inhibit other A1b/159N strains but are less effective against strains from other clades.
However, each serum against a A1b/159N strain produces slightly different antigenic distances to strains from other clades.
With only 14 heterologous titer measurements available, sera against A/Darwin/6/2021 appears to only inhibit A1b/159N strains.
Strains from A1b/137F and A1b/186S have a ~3-fold reduction in titers to A/Darwin/6/2021 sera.
A/Bangladesh/10006/2020 appears to weakly inhibit A1b/137F strains and half of recently circulating A1b/186S strains.
A/Bangladesh/911009/2020 appears to inhibit A1b/186D strains but not A1b/186S strains.
These patterns suggest that covering A1b/159N and other circulating clades may be somewhat mutually exclusive, but some candidates could provide moderate cross-reactivity.

Candidate strains like A/Darwin/6/2021 carry egg-passaging mutations.
The egg-passaged strain for A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 has additional HA1 mutations including T160K and S186R.
Both egg-passaged strains for A/Darwin/6/2021 and A/Bangladesh/3005/2020 have HA1:D186N and D225G mutations.
A/Tasmania/503/2020 has HA1:T160K, H183Y, and D225G mutations.
A/Pennsylvania/1026/2019 has HA1:T160K, G186V, and S219Y mutations.
A/HongKong/2671/2019 has HA1:T160I, G186V, and D225N mutations.
A/Perth/20/2020 has HA1:T160K and S219Y mutations.
These passage-related mutations appear to dramatically alter the antigenic profile of the original reference strains.

The triple deletion clade, V1A.3, has fixed globally and, of the 543 strains observed since September 1, 2020, 518 (95%) are from its V1A.3/150K subclade and 20 (4%) are from its V1A.3/133R subclade.
An additional 5 strains (1%) descend from a distinct subclade circulating in Kenya and characterized by HA1:K75E, G230N, and I267V mutations.

The V1A.3/150K clade has diverged into two distinct subclades characterized by HA1:P144L and HA1:V220M mutations, respectively.

V1A.3/220M has circulated almost entirely in China with two strains observed in Russia.
With the exception of a single A/H1N1pdm strain, V1A.3/220M represents the only influenza data collected in China since last September.
Although few amino acid mutations have emerged in 220M, we observed recurrent HA1:R80K mutations in three subclades and two separate mutations at HA1:122 (H122N and H122Q)
Interestingly, a HA1:165R insertion has also appeared in this clade.

V1A.3/144L is globally distributed with observations in North America, Africa, Europe, West Asia, Southeast Asia, and China.
The 144L strains from China all belong to a single clade with the same HA1:H122Q mutation that appeared independently in the V1A.3/220M clade in China.
This HA1:122Q subclade has circulated entirely in China where it picked up a HA1:-165N insertion three times, possibly through convergent evolution.

Outside of China, 144L strains exhibit geographic structure.
Subclades with HA1:A202V have emerged independently in South Africa and Bangladesh, with apparent onward transmission from Bangladesh to Singapore.
Another subclade with HA1:T182A, D197E, and T221A mutations has circulated primarily in West Africa and France with limited onward transmission to the United States, Austria, and Russia.

These patterns are consistent with moderate geographic restrictions associated with the pandemic outside of China and much stronger restrictions between China and the rest of the world.

The current vaccine strain, B/Washington/2/2019, continues to effectively inhibit other V1A.3/133R strains but it weakly inhibits strains from V1A.3/220M and V1A.3/144L.
Sera raised against B/Maryland/24/2019 produce a similar pattern.
A previous vaccine candidate from V1A.3/150K, B/RhodeIsland/1/2019, also fails to cover recent V1A.3/144L strains.
Sera raised against strains from V1A.3/144L, including B/Michigan/1/2021, appear effective against strains from the same clade.
Although there are only a few available measurements, sera against B/Victoria/2113/2019 seem to cover strains from both recent V1A.3/150K subclades.

Antigenic distances for egg-passaged strains show similar patterns to cell-passaged strains.
The egg-passaged B/Michigan/1/2021 appears to only cover V1A.3/144L strains, while the egg-passaged B/Sichuan-Jingyang/12048/2019 (the only candidate from V1A.3/220M) may cover strains from both clades.
More measurements for the egg-passaged B/Sichuan-Jingyang/12048/2019 against strains from V1A.3/150K subclades could strengthen this assessement.
However, if V1A.3/220M remains limited to circulation in China and Russia, a candidate that inhibits the globally distributed V1A.3/144L may be a higher priority.
