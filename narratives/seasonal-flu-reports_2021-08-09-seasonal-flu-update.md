# [H3N2: 159N and 186S dominate recent submissions](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month&p=grid)

Of 45 strains submitted in the last month, 28 strains are from 159N and 14 from 186S. Three are older strains from 137F with the most recent of these from New Zealand in December 2020.

Recent 159N strains were sampled from Norway, Nepal, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya.

# [H3N2: 156 mutations partition recent 159N strains](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_156&d=tree,map&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=grid)

Mutations at site HA1:156 partition recent 159N strains into three major groups with ancestral 156H circulating in the US, Europe, West Asia, South Asia, Singapore, and Kenya, 156S in Australia, the US, Russia, and Europe, and 156Q in Kenya, United Arab Emirates, and India.

# [H3N2: 45T mutation frequency growing in 186S clade](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_45&d=tree,map&label=clade:A1b/186S&p=grid)

A 45T mutation in the 186S clade is growing but only circulating in Timor-Leste and Australia currently.

# [H3N2: Recently submitted 137F strains carry an additional 144T mutation](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_144&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month&label=clade:A1b/137F&p=grid)

In 2019, 137F strains picked up a 144N mutation and two of the most recently submitted 137F strains mutated again to 144T.

# [H3N2: 159N has highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree&l=scatter&p=full)

159N dominates LBI with the 156Q subclade growing quickly, too.

# [H3N2: 159N is most antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree&l=scatter&p=full&scatterY=cTiterSub)

159N is the most antigenically advanced clade by the titer substitution model (based on FRA data). The same pattern generally holds for the tree model although the gain over other clades is not as strong with the tree model.

# [H3N2: Both forecast models favor growth of 159N](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree&l=scatter&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)

As expected by the LBI and antigenic advance values above, both forecasting models favor growth of 159N.

# [H3N2: Antigenic distances with cell-based FRA data](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h3n2/ha/2y)

Cambodian vaccine strain covers available 94N test viruses.
However, Bangladeshi strains from 159N cover 159N better than all other reference strains.

# [H1N1pdm: 187A dominates recent strains](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month&p=grid)

Of the 59 strains submitted in the last month, 57 are from 187A and two are from 183P-7. With these recent 183P-7 strains, all major pre-pandemic clades have been observed once since late 2020.

All of the recent 187A strains were collected in Togo while the two 183P-7 strains were collected in Norway.

# [H1N1pdm: 166 and 186 mutations partition recent 187A strains](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?c=gt-HA1_166,186,232&d=tree,map&dmin=2020-09-25&label=clade:6b1.A/187A&p=grid)

Recent 187A strains in Togo predominantly carry 166T and 186T mutations. These mutations are also at high frequency in Ghana and Niger.

# [H1N1pdm: 166T/186T subclade of 187A has highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=lbi&d=tree&label=clade:6b1.A/187A&m=div&p=full)

The subclade with 166T and 186T has the highest LBI.

# [H1N1pdm: 156K clade is most antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h1n1pdm/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&l=scatter&m=div&p=full&scatterX=num_date&scatterY=cTiterSub)

In contrast with the higher LBI of the 187A clade, the 156K clade has the highest antigenic advance by both substitution and tree models.

# [H1N1pdm: Antigenic distances with cell-based HI data](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/h1n1pdm/ha/2y)

Most references cover 187A, but only Victoria/2570 covers 156K

# [Vic: Recent strains represent major clades](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month&label=clade:V1A.3&p=grid)

The 36 strains submitted in the last month represent V1A.3/133R (N=5, all from Kenya), 150K (N=26 from Singapore, China, and Kenya), and V1A.3 (N=5, all from Kenya).

# [Vic: Recent 150K strains from Singapore carry a 202V mutation](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_202&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month&gt=HA1.144L&m=div&p=grid)

Of the 19 strains in this cluster, a group of 15 and another of 3 are identical.

# [Vic: A 165N insertion arose multiple times in China](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y?d=tree,map&branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_165&f_recency=last%20month&gt=HA1.122Q&p=grid)

A 165N insertion appears to have arisen three independent times in China since late 2020.

# [Vic: Recent V1A.3 strains from Kenya carry multiple HA1 mutations](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month&gt=HA1.75E&m=div&p=grid)

Recent V1A.3 strains from Kenya carry HA1 mutations including K75E, G230N, and I267V.

# [Vic: 220M/241Q subclade of 150K has the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y?c=lbi&d=tree&l=scatter&m=div&p=full&scatterX=num_date)

The 150K subclade with 220M and 241Q has the highest LBI.

# [Vic: 150K has the highest antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y?d=tree&l=scatter&label=clade:V1A.3/150K&p=full&scatterY=cTiterSub)

The 150K clade has the highest antigenic advance. Specifically, the subclade with 144L and 203R has over 1.5 log2 titer increase over the 241Q subclade.

# [Vic: Antigenic distances with cell-based HI data](https://nextstrain.org/staging/flu/seasonal/2021-08-08/vic/ha/2y)

Nigeria/3352 and Brisbane/35 may cover both 150K and 133R, although there are few measurements between these references and test strains in 150K.
