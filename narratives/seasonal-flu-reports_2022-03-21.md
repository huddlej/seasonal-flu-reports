# [Recent H3N2 submissions](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)
Of the 222 genomes submitted in the last month, most (N=214 or 96%) map to 2a.2.
Other non-2a.2 samples were collected in Africa, with 6 from 1a in Western and Eastern Africa and 2 from 1b in Kenya.

# [Small 53S subclade appears in 53G clade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53&d=tree,frequencies&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2/53G&p=full)
A small 53S subclade has appeared in the 53G clade of 2a.2 with samples collected in three contiguous European countries (Netherlands, Germany, and Austria) and Lebanon.

# [Parallel 50K subclades continue to persist](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=region&d=tree,map,frequencies&dmin=2021-03-15&gt=HA1.50K&p=grid)
Globally distributed subclades with 50K mutations continue to persist at about 10% of global frequency.
Each subclade appears to have a broad geographic distribution indicating multiple independent emergences and subsequent transmission across regions instead of independent contained emergences per region.

# [Large antigenic advance associated with 104G and 276R mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=gt-HA1_53,104,156&d=tree&gt=HA1.156S&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full&scatterY=cTiterSub)
In previous analyses, most antigenic advance was associated with 156S strains, but recent data now show a slight advance for 156S (0.5 log2 gain) and 53G (1 log2 gain), and a larger advance for 104G and 276R mutations (~2 log2 gain).
This signal for 104G/276R is driven by measurements from A/Maryland/2/2021, a strain within the 104G/276R clade whose antisera effectively inhibits other strains from the same clade but not from sister clades.
This pattern appears asymmetrical in that other references sera show no difference in ability to inhibit 104G/276R.

# [53G and 53N subclades have the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=lbi&d=tree&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full)
The 53G and 53N subclades of 2a.2 have the highest LBI, driven mostly by strains collected in the Americas and Europe.

# [Forecasts differ slightly in outcomes for 2a.2 subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&d=tree,frequencies&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)
Although forecasts from FRA- and LBI-based models strongly agree across all clades, they differ in predictions about the 53G and 53N subclades of 2a.2.
The FRA-based model slighly prefers 53G strains, as seen in by the tips above the regression line and the higher projected frequencies of these strains.
These predictions are likely driven by the high antigenic advance of the 104G/276R subclade that is itself driven by a handful of measurements from A/Maryland/2/2021.
The LBI-based model slightly prefers 53N strains, as seen by the tips below the regression line.

# [Recent H1N1pdm circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)
Of 82 strains submitted in the last month, most (N=69 or 84%) originate from 5a.1 in Europe and Africa.
The remaining 13 strains map to 5a.2 in Europe, West Asia, and South Asia.
All strains in Africa belong to a 5a.1 subclade with a 113K mutation.
This clade also carries recurrent 152I mutations in Niger and South Africa.
The same 152I mutation also appears in a Bangladeshi subclade of 5a.2.

# [5a.2 subclade with 54Q, 186T, etc. remains antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&label=clade:6B.1A.5a&p=full)
Recent data more clearly delineate the antigenic differences between the ancestral 156K strains, the subclade with 130N, and the most recent subclade with 54Q, 186T, etc.

# [Multiple subclades have high LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=lbi&d=tree&p=full)
The subclade of 5a.1 with an HA2:183T mutation has one of the highest LBIs in the tree, but multiple clades have relatively high LBIs across the tree.
