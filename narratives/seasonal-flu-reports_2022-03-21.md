abstract: H3N2 remains split between 2a.2 subclades with 53N and 53G with recent antigenic data showing advance in 53G strains with 104G and 276R mutations. Little has changed in H1N1pdm in the last month; 5a.2 remains the most antigenically advanced, but 5a.1 still circulates at higher frequencies. In Vic, independent emergences of 197E mutations show antigenic advance and global circulation, while similar independent emergences of 202V remain in their original regions.

# [Recent H3N2 submissions](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)
Of the 222 genomes submitted in the last month, most (N=214 or 96%) map to 2a.2.
Other non-2a.2 samples were collected in Africa, with 6 from 1a in Western and Eastern Africa and 2 from 1b in Kenya.

# [Small 53S subclade appears in 53G clade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=gt-HA1_53&d=tree,frequencies&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2/53G&p=full)
A small 53S subclade has appeared in the 53G clade of 2a.2 with samples collected in three contiguous European countries (Netherlands, Germany, and Austria) and Lebanon.

# [Parallel 50K subclades continue to persist](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=region&d=tree,map,frequencies&dmin=2021-03-15&gt=HA1.50K&p=grid)
Globally distributed subclades with 50K mutations continue to persist at about 10% of global frequency.
Each subclade appears to have a broad geographic distribution indicating multiple independent emergences and subsequent transmission across regions instead of independent contained emergences per region.

# [Large antigenic advance associated with 104G and 276R mutations](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=gt-HA1_53,104,156&d=tree&gt=HA1.156S&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full&scatterY=cTiterSub)
In previous analyses, most antigenic advance was associated with 156S strains, but recent data now show a slight advance for 156S (0.5 log2 gain) and 53G (1 log2 gain), and a larger advance for 104G and 276R mutations (~2 log2 gain).
This signal for 104G/276R is driven by measurements from A/Maryland/2/2021, a strain within the 104G/276R clade whose antisera effectively inhibits other strains from the same clade but not from sister clades.
This pattern appears asymmetrical in that other references sera show no difference in ability to inhibit 104G/276R.

# [53G and 53N subclades have the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=lbi&d=tree&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full)
The 53G and 53N subclades of 2a.2 have the highest LBI, driven mostly by strains collected in the Americas and Europe.

# [Forecasts differ slightly in outcomes for 2a.2 subclades](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&d=tree,frequencies&l=scatter&p=full&regression=show&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)
Although forecasts from FRA- and LBI-based models strongly agree across all clades, they differ in predictions about the 53G and 53N subclades of 2a.2.
The FRA-based model slighly prefers 53G strains, as seen in by the tips above the regression line and the higher projected frequencies of these strains.
These predictions are likely driven by the high antigenic advance of the 104G/276R subclade that is itself driven by a handful of measurements from A/Maryland/2/2021.
The LBI-based model slightly prefers 53N strains, as seen by the tips below the regression line.

# [Recent H1N1pdm circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)
Of 82 strains submitted in the last month, most (N=69 or 84%) originate from 5a.1 in Europe and Africa.
The remaining 13 strains map to 5a.2 in Europe, West Asia, and South Asia.
All strains in Africa belong to a 5a.1 subclade with a 113K mutation.
This clade also carries recurrent 152I mutations in Niger and South Africa.
The same 152I mutation also appears in a Bangladeshi subclade of 5a.2.

# [5a.2 subclade with 54Q, 186T, etc. remains antigenically advanced](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&label=clade:6B.1A.5a&p=full)
Recent data more clearly delineate the antigenic differences between the ancestral 156K strains, the subclade with 130N, and the most recent subclade with 54Q, 186T, etc.

# [Multiple subclades have high LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=lbi&d=tree&p=full)
The subclade of 5a.1 with an HA2:183T mutation has one of the highest LBIs in the tree, but multiple clades have relatively high LBIs across the tree.

# [Recent Vic circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)
Of the 43 strains submitted in the last month, 40 (93%) map to 3a.2 and the remaining 3 map to a subclade of V1A.3 with 155A and 128K mutations.
These latter 3 strains were all collected in Kenya and descend from a previous subclade of entirely Kenyan strains with 75E and 230N mutations.

# [A 3a.2 subclade with 197E continues to circulate](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=gt-HA1_197&d=tree,map,frequencies&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=grid)
Of the 40 recent 3a.2 strains, more than half (N=25) descend from a subclade with a 197E mutation.
This clade represents one of four independent emergences of 197E in recent 3a.2 strains.

# [Four separate 197E emergences occurred in Africa and Asia](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?branchLabel=aa&c=region&d=tree&gt=HA1.197E&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=full)
The four separate emergences of 197E in 3a.2 likely appeared in West or South Asia (N=1), Africa (N=2), and China (N=1).
The clade from West/South Asia and one from Africa both displayed substantial onward transmission, while the clade from China has only three samples and the most recent clade from Africa has only one sample.
Both clades with onward transmission have circulated globally in the last year to four regions (in the case of the African origin) and seven regions (in the case of the West/South Asian origin).

# [Five separate 202V emergences occurred in Africa, Asia, and Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?branchLabel=aa&c=region&d=tree,map&gt=HA1.202V&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=grid)
Although 202V mutations emerged five separate times in 3a.2 in the last two years (in South Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia again, and Europe), nearly all onward transmission from these clades remained in the same major geographic region.
Collectively, strains with the 202V mutation peaked at 35% global frequency in the summer of 2021 and now comprise only 13% of recent strains.

# [3a.2 appears to be gradually replacing 3a.1 in China](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=map,frequencies&dmin=2018-01-01&f_region=China&p=full&r=division)
At the beginning of the pandemic, 3a.1 represented <1% of strains in China, 3a.2 represented 3%, and V1A.3 was dominant at 85%.
Over the course of 2020, 3a.1 swept to a peak frequency of 90% in October 2020.
Since then 3a.2 began to outcompete 3a.1 and now represents 70% of strains in China.

# [HA1:197 mutations appear to drive recent antigenic advance in 3a.2](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=gt-HA1_128,197&d=tree&l=scatter&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=full&r=division)
Multiple HA1:197 mutations from D to E or N drive increased antigenic advance in 3a.2.
Additional mutations at HA1:128K, 129N, and 220M also show antigenic advance.

# [The highest LBI belongs to a subclade originating from South Asia](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2022-03-21/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=lbi&d=tree,map&gt=nuc.1196A,1130A,HA1.144L&label=clade:V1A.3a.2&p=grid)
The clade with its earliest strains in Nepal and India has an LBI of 1 and has spread to West Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia.
This subclade happens to appear within one of the most successful subclades with 197E.
