title: Seasonal influenza report for October 5, 2021
authors: John Huddleston

abstract: "Seasonal influenza populations circulating since September 1, 2020 generally exhibit reduced numbers, strong geographic structure, convergent evolution, and HA/NA reassortment. Vaccine candidates for A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 target mutually exclusive clades within each subtype, complicating the process of selecting a single vaccine candidate per subtype. A/H3N2 egg-passaged candidates carry multiple amino acid mutations that dramatically reduce antigenicity. Two B/Vic candidates may cover all extant clades."

# [All recent H3N2 strains belong to 94N subclades](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

A1b/186S strains all originate from Laos.
A1b/159N strains are globally distributed with some back-filled strains from late 2020/early 2021 in India.

# [Recent A1b/159N strains map to 156S subclade](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/159N&p=grid)

A1b/159N strains submitted in the last week map to a subclade with a HA1:156S mutation and subclades with HA1:D53N and G mutations.
Strains were collected in the USA, Russia, Spain, and the Netherlands.

# [156S mutation is associated with antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week&label=clade:A1b/94N&p=grid)

A1b/159N strains with the 156S mutation have higher antigenic advance than other recent strains.
