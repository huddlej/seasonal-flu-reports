abstract: “Recent submissions from Brazil show circulation of all three major lineages since the start of the pandemic. H3N2 strains from a recent Michigan outbreak were previously missing from analyses because they only have HA (instead of HA and NA). The titer substitution model based on FRA data for H3N2 suggest that the HA1:53G subclade may be slightly antigenically advanced even relative to its ancestors carrying HA1:156S.“

# [Recent H3N2 circulation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)
213 genomes in the last month with most (195) from 2a.2 (including 48 from Brazil), 15 from 1b (all from Kenya), three from 1a (Nigeria, Kenya, and Australia).

# [HA1:53N and G mutations following HA1:156S continue to grow in frequency](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=gt-HA1_53&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150&p=grid)
Considering only the 740 strains collected in the last year, HA1:156S accounts for 63% of recent strains.
Similarly, HA1:53N accounts for 40% of recent strains and 53G for 21%.
53G is dominant in the United States, Russia, and Lebanon.
53N is dominant in Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Croatia, and Nepal and is well-represented in India and Australia.
Clades carrying the ancestral genotype at 53D are still dominant in Africa, West Asia, most of Southeast Asia, and Oceania.

# [Recent FRA data detect a slight antigenic advance for 53G over 53N](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=cTiterSub&d=tree&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full)
Although the primary antigenic advance for recent 2a.2 strains corresponds to the 156S subclade (with an antigenic advance of 6.07 log2 titers from the root compared to 4.88 for its immediate ancestor), the 53G subclade has a slightly higher advance of 6.60 log2 titers.

# [53N is more widely distributed despite its slightly lower antigenic advance](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&branches=hide&c=gt-HA1_53&d=tree&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150&l=scatter&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&p=full&scatterX=region&scatterY=cTiterSub)
Strains from the 53N subclade are more widely distributed globally appearing in South Asia, South America, and Oceania more frequenctly than 53G.

# [Strains from recent outbreaks in Michigan and Maryland carry a new 157I mutation](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=gt-HA1_157&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150&label=clade:3C.2a1b.2a.2&m=div&p=grid&r=division)
Large outbreaks in Michigan and Maryland carry a HA1:L157I mutation.
These strains also carry mutations at another epitope site, HA1:S262N.
Michigan strains were not included in previous reports due to our default constraint that strains have both an HA and NA segment; most strains from the University of Michigan (UOM strains) only have an HA segment.

# [H3N2 circulation appears geographically structured within the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?c=gt-HA1_53&d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150&p=grid&r=division)
Since June 2021, H3N2 strains from different clades rarely appear in the same states.
There appears to be an east/west structure to the distribution of 53N, 53G, and ancestral strains with 53D.

# [Recent 1b strains from Kenya form a clade with previous strains from France](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branchLabel=aa&c=country&d=tree&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146,202147,202148,202149,202150&label=clade:3C.2a1b.1b&p=full)
Most recent 1b strains from Kenya cluster with previously observed strains from France.
These strains form a subclade with a long temporal branch and only two amino acid mutations (HA1:K310R and HA2:A201V).

# [LBI forecasts slightly prefer 53N, antigenic forecasts favor 156S](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h3n2/ha/2y/cell/fra?branches=hide&c=gt-HA1_53,156,159&d=tree&l=scatter&m=div&p=full&scatterX=weighted_distance_to_future_by_cTiter_x-ne_star&scatterY=weighted_distance_to_future_by_ne_star-lbi)
Both forecast models still generally agree that 2a.2 is most representative of the likely future population.
However, the LBI-based model slightly prefers the 53N subclade, while the antigenic novelty models favors the 156S subclade more generally.
The slight antigenic advance of 53G suggested by the titer substitution model does not appear to influence the antigenic novelty model’s forecasts (which are based on the titer tree model).

# [Most recently submitted H1N1pdm data map to 5a.1 from Nigeria](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_recency=last%20week,last%20month&p=grid)
22 strains of H1N1pdm were submitted in the last month with 15 from 5a.1 (in Nigeria, South Africa, Norway, and the USA), four from 5a.2 (in the USA and Australia), one from 5b (in Brazil), and two from 6B.1A.1 (in the USA).
The 6B.1A.1 strains form a clade with a previous strain from North Dakota.
These strains carry 6 HA1 mutations and 4 HA2 mutations.

# [5a.1 and 5a.2 circulate at similar frequencies with different geographic distributions](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202139&p=grid)
As previously observed, 5a.1. and 5a.2 have distinct geographic distributions, despite reaching roughly equal global frequencies (46% and 50%, respectively).
5a.1 has been primarily observed in India, Bangladesh, and Australia.
5a.2 has been observed in Africa and Europe.

# [The USA represents much of H1N1pdm’s recent diversity](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202139&p=grid&r=division)
All major clades have been observed in the USA in the last year.
However, strains from these clades have not been observed in the same states with the exception of Iowa.

# [5a.2 remains the most antigenically advanced clade](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=cTiterSub&d=tree,map&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144&p=grid&r=division)
Ferret HI data continue to support 5a.2 as antigenically advanced.
Interestingly, none of the recent HA1 mutations observed in India and Bangladesh carry any additional antigenic weight from the titer substitution model.

# [5a.2 also has the highest LBI](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/h1n1pdm/ha/2y/cell/hi?c=lbi&d=tree&f_epiweek=202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202117,202118,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202129,202130,202131,202132,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144&p=full&r=division)
These higher LBI values map to the most recent strains from India and Bangladesh.

# [Recently submitted Vic data are from 3a.2 and V1A.3](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map&f_recency=last%20month,last%20week&p=grid)
59 B/Victoria strains were submitted in the last month.
42 of these descend from 3a.2 (in Singapore, the USA, Australia, South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria).
17 strains are from V1A.3 (in the USA, Brazil, and Kenya).

# [3a.2 dominates strains from the last year but V1A.3 continues to circulate](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_epiweek=202050,202051,202052,202053,202101,202102,202103,202104,202105,202106,202107,202108,202109,202110,202111,202112,202113,202114,202115,202116,202117,202118,202119,202120,202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146&p=grid)
3a.2 represents 73% of recent B/Vic strains, but V1A.3 continues to circulate.

# [As with H1N1pdm, Vic circulation in the USA appears structured](https://nextstrain.org/community/huddlej/seasonal-flu-reports/flu/seasonal/2021-12-27/vic/ha/2y/cell/hi?d=tree,map&f_country=Usa&f_epiweek=202121,202122,202123,202124,202125,202126,202127,202128,202129,202130,202131,202132,202133,202134,202135,202136,202137,202138,202139,202140,202141,202142,202143,202144,202145,202146&label=clade:V1A.3&p=grid&r=division)
Since July 2021, Vic strains in the USA from different clades rarely appear in the same state.
We observed the same pattern for H1N1pdm.
